I was once asked about transitioning to a career in data science by three different UChicago grad students over a short period of time, so I decided to put together this outline in case anyone else was curious.

    - "Data analyst" will probably be less exciting than "data scientist" for those with a scientific background.

- <a name="Get-Experience"></a>**Get Experience!**
  - Intern - this is the best possible thing you can do.
  - Try out [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions.
  - Create a [LinkedIn account](http://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelaalcorn) and keep it updated.
- <a name="Curriculum"></a>[**Curriculum**](https://github.com/airalcorn2/Michael-s-Data-Science-Curriculum)
  - Free Courses - use them
    - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/), [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), [Saylor](http://www.saylor.org/), [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)
    - Can use [my course history](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CJ4khRtvkr3v-44cfJfVkg_gpGdKgY1DlOzVO8MYAS8/edit#gid=0) as a guide.
  - Math
    - Calculus (at least up to partial derivatives, which is typically Calculus III)
    - Linear Algebra
    - Analysis (advanced)
  - Statistics - know Bayesian and frequentist theory
  - Algorithms
  - Machine Learning - know the big algorithms; natural language processing is probably the most useful subfield to learn
  - Other Topics - graphs, game theory, information theory, etc.
- <a name="Programming"></a>**Programming**
  - Must know [Python](https://www.python.org/). Almost all data scientist positions require cleansing and transforming data on a large scale and Python is typically the language of choice for this task.
  - Important Python packages/libraries → [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/), [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/), [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), [Statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/)
  - Must know [R](http://www.r-project.org/).
  - Should know your way around a *nix terminal.
  - Version control - should know basics of [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
  - Put personal projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/airalcorn2).
  - Contribute to open source projects.
- <a name="Databases"></a>**Databases** - definitely know [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), should probably look into [NoSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) databases as well (e.g., [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/))
  - The best way to learn databases is by working with them. Find a database and practice writing queries for it.
- <a name="Big-Data-Tools"></a>**Big Data Tools**
  - Be familiar with the following: [**Apache Hadoop**](https://hadoop.apache.org/), [**MapReduce**](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html), [**Apache Spark**](http://spark.apache.org/), [Apache Pig](https://pig.apache.org/), [Apache Hive](https://hive.apache.org/), [Apache Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/), [Apache Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/), [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/)
